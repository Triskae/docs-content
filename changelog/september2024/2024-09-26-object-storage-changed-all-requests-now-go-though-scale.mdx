The rollout of the new gateway is now completed in all Regions, as the http PUT requests now also go through the new Gateway, leading to a significative performance improvement especially on p50 and p90 for PUT requests. Work in progress will bring further improvements on p95, p99 and p99,9 percentiles for PUT method.
